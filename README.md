# Home Assistant Lovelace Kindle Screensaver

![ci](https://github.com/sibbl/hass-lovelace-kindle-screensaver/workflows/ci/badge.svg)

This tool can be used to display a Lovelace view of your Home Assistant instance on a [jailbroken](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=320564) Kindle device. It regularly takes a screenshot which can be polled and used as a screensaver image of the [online screensaver plugin](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=236104).

If you're looking for a way to render your own HTML, see my other project [hass-kindle-screensaver](https://github.com/sibbl/hass-kindle-screensaver) which renders a React page and can be adapted to your specific needs.

## Sample image

## Features

This tool regularly takes a screenshot of a specific page of your home assistant setup. It converts it into the PNG grayscale format which Kindles can display.

Using my [own Kindle 4 setup guide](https://github.com/sibbl/hass-lovelace-kindle-4) or the [online screensaver extension](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=236104) for any jailbroken Kindle, this image can be regularly polled from your device so you can use it as a weather station, a display for next public transport departures etc.

## Usage

You may simple set up the [sibbl/hass-lovelace-kindle-screensaver](https://hub.docker.com/r/sibbl/hass-lovelace-kindle-screensaver) docker container. The container exposes a single port (5000 by default).

You can access the image by doing a simple GET request to e.g. `http://localhost:5000/` to receive the most recent image.

**\* Array** means that you can set `HA_SCREENSHOT_URL_2`, `HA_SCREENSHOT_URL_3`, ... `HA_SCREENSHOT_URL_n` to render multiple pages within the same instance.
If you use `HA_SCREENSHOT_URL_2`, you can also set `ROTATION_2=180`. If there is no `ROTATION_n` set, then `ROTATION` will be used as a fallback.
You can access these additional images by making GET Requests `http://localhost:5000/2`, `http://localhost:5000/3.png` etc.

You may also simply use the `docker-compose.yml` file inside this repository, configure everything in there and run `docker-compose up`.

### Other endpoints

From time to time, you may need to restart the process. You can do this by sending a `GET` request to `/exit` endpoint. This will exit the process. Simply set your docker container to *restart: unless-stopped* to automatically restart it.

`http://localhost:5000/exit`

### Advanced configuration

Some advanced variables for local usage which shouldn't be necessary when using Docker:

- `OUTPUT_PATH=./output.png` (destination of rendered image. `OUTPUT_2`, `OUTPUT_3`, ... is also supported)
- `PORT=5000` (port of server, which returns the last image)
- `USE_IMAGE_MAGICK=false` (use ImageMagick instead of GraphicsMagick)
- `UNSAFE_IGNORE_CERTIFICATE_ERRORS=true` (ignore certificate errors of e.g. self-signed certificates at your own risk)

### Docker

There is a [automated build on the Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/lanrat/hass-screenshot/). [`lanrat/hass-screenshot`](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/lanrat/hass-screenshot/)
